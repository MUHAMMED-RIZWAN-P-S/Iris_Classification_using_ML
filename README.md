An introductory project for people trying to enter into the field of machine learning. In this project we use data of three different species of a flower called "Iris". We use numerical attributes of the three species to find a pattern and hence using the pattern to train a machine learning model which can classify between the three species upto a certain accuracy.

Language: Python
Platform: Jupyter Notebook
